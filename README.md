# lentildip

Budget home made bean dip, high fibre, low cost!

## Ingredients

 2 cups green lentils - dry
16 oz bottle of pace picante sauce (medium or hot)

## Equipment

 1 x 5+ quart pot/kettle
 1 x potato masher or eletric blender

## Prep

In cold water, thoroughly clean and rinse the lentils by submerging
them and/or rinsing them in a strainer.

## Process

Place the lentils in the pot and cover by at least a couple of
inches, they will soak up a considerable amount of water, so monitor
the process for overflows and low water situations.

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to just below boiling.

Continue to monitor, add water if necessary, for approximately 45-55
minutes until the lentils are fully soft/cooked.

You can stir, but try to minimize disturbing or breaking up the
lentils (otherwise you will rinse away alot of the product).

Remove from heat and *gently* pour out the excess liquid without
overly squishing the lentils.

In the stove top kettle, mix the lentils with the full 16oz jar of
Pace Picante sauce and blend until smooth.

Taste with a chip or two, add more picante sauce if not hot enough.

Take care when adding more sauce as too much may make the final
mixure too wet.

Feel free to experiement, this was optimized for low cost, and the
ubiquity of pace picante sauce and lentils.
